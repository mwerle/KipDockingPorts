About:
======

The *Kip Docking Ports* mod is a set of specialised docking ports for *Kerbal Space Program*.

This mod is a combined re-release of two mods originally created by **Captain Kipard** : *Non-Androgynous Docking Ports* and *Universal Docking Ports*.

The Non-Androgynous Docking Ports are a matching set of gendered docking ports for the 1.25m stack. The Universal Docking Ports are aimed at orbital construction tugs and each allows docking to several different docking port sizes.

--------------------------------------------------

Installation:
=============

**NB**: If upgrading from Kips' original mods, move the *\<KSP Directory\>/GameData/KipEng* folder somewhere safe first. It may contain several of Kips mods and you may want to keep some parts which are not included in this mod.

1. Delete the *\<KSP directory\>/GameData/KipEng* folder if it exists.

2. Copy the contents of the Gamedata directory into *\<KSP directory\>/GameData/*

--------------------------------------------------

Non-Androgynous Docking Ports:
==============================

The docking ports are available earlier in the tech tree to allow players to create small space stations and orbit rendezvous mission earlier, however they are more difficult to use than the normal docking ports.

The Non-Androgynous Docking Ports work the same way a regular docking port would, with the following exceptions:
- These ports are incompatible with any other docking ports in the game.
- These ports come in "Active" and "Passive" genders. Only ports of opposite gender can dock to each other.
- These ports can only dock when they are ligned up with each other.

To capture, the ports must be almost perfectly aligned with each other. Once captured, rotate the ship slightly in order to actually dock.

--------------------------------------------------

Universal Docking Ports:
========================

These ports are useful for orbital construction tugs as each can connect to multiple different sized ports. The drawback is that they do not allow Kerbals to pass through them if Connected Living Space is installed and sst to realistic mode. They are also bulkier than standard docking ports.

--------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
=============

This mod has no dependencies, but is supports the following mods:

- Connected Living Space : the docking ports have configurations for Connected Living Space.
